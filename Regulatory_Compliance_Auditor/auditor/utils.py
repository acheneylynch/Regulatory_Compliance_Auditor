"""
Module providing utility functions for this project.

These functions are general purpose utilities used by other modules in this project.
Some of these functions were exercises in early course modules and should be copied
over into this file.

The preconditions for many of these functions are quite messy.  While this makes writing
the functions simpler (because the preconditions ensure we have less to worry about),
enforcing these preconditions can be quite hard. That is why it is not necessary to
enforce any of the preconditions in this module.

    This function should just use the parse function in dateutil.parser to
    convert the timestamp to a datetime object.  If it is not a valid date (so
    the parser crashes), this function should return None.

    If the timestamp has a time zone, then it should keep that time zone even if
    the value for tzsource is not None.  Otherwise, if timestamp has no time zone
    and tzsource is not None, then this function will use tzsource to assign
    a time zone to the new datetime object.

    The value for tzsource can be None, a string, or a datetime object.  If it

def daytime(time, daycycle):
    """
    Returns true if the time takes place during the day.

    A time is during the day if it is after sunrise but before sunset, as
    indicated by the daycycle dicitionary.

    A daycycle dictionary has keys for several years (as int).  The value for
    each year is also a dictionary, taking strings of the form 'mm-dd'.  The
    value for that key is a THIRD dictionary, with two keys "sunrise" and
    "sunset".  The value for each of those two keys is a string in 24-hour
    time format.

    For example, here is what part of a daycycle dictionary might look like:

        "2015": {
            "01-01": {
                "sunrise": "07:35",
                "sunset":  "16:44"

                "sunset":  "16:45"
            },
            ...
        }

    In addition, the daycycle dictionary has a key 'timezone' that expresses the
    timezone as a string. This function uses that timezone when constructing
    datetime objects from this set.  If the time parameter does not have a timezone,
    we assume that it is in the same timezone as the daycycle dictionary
